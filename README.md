## Description 
I have created a Fitness Tracker that helps users track their exercises. On the main page users can add a new workout or update a current workout to include more exercises. Exercises can include resistance or cardio and allows user to input values for duration, distance, weight, reps, and sets. The app also provides graphs of duration and weight lifted over the past 7 workouts.
